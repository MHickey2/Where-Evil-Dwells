INTRO = '''
You are invited to a reading of a Will at Harland Manor,
an old house steeped in mystery...
With a long history of murder and debauchery.
It is in relation to your great uncle Raymon DeCharles,
It is a frightening prospect, but you really need the money
'''

ARRIVAL = '''
You have arrived at Harland Manor, all dressed up
and ready for anything. The Butler Jeeves answers
your knocking at the door and beckons you inside.
He tells you the other guests have not arrived yet
and he invites you to wait in the lounge. You follow
him in, full of trepidation...

Here we go, Adventure begins!
'''

LETTER = '''
Dear Guests, I have a warning for you. There is a
Killer among you, someone in this house would like
the inheritance for themselves. You are advised to
protect yourself at all costs. The best advice for
you is to pick a fellow guest and isolate yourself
within a bubble. You can not leave the house, or
your inheritance is forfeited. Make the right
choices and you will survive the night... Choose the
wrong one and your game is over!
