Dear Guests, I have a warning for you. There is a Killer among you, someone in this house would
like the inheritance for themselves. You are advised to protect yourself at all costs. The best advice
for you is to pick a fellow guest and isolate yourself within a bubble. You can not leave the house, 
or your inheritance is forfeited. Make the right choices and you will survive the night... Choose the
wrong one and your game is over!
